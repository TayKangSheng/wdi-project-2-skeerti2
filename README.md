# Your Project Name

Kitchen Wonders has been created as a food delivery app by home cooks and stay at home moms. Each chef has a list of dishes( and also cuisines) and the user can place the order if he wishes to. The user can also review the chef. Chefs are hard coded and hence cannot be edited.
## Getting Started

Clone the file and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### How to Use

The user must login to view any chef/dishes and place order. Create an account if he/she doesn't have one.
