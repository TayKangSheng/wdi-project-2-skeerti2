# Kitchen Wonders
Kitchen Wonders has been created as a food delivery app by home cooks and stay at home moms. Each chef has a list of dishes( and also cuisines) and the customer can place the order if he wishes to after login. The customer can also review the chef in the 'Add a review' section. In order to become a chef, a user can create a Chef account and add his/her information.

## Getting Started
Clone the file and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### How to Use
* To become a chef, create a chef account.
* One can add the details (recipes, intro, etc.) to his/her Chef profile.
* To become a customer, create a customer account.
* In the homepage, one can either search for a chef(if he/she has found a favorite), search by cuisine or look at all the chef profiles.
* An option to review a chef's food is included.

* ejs
* bootstrap
* passport
* node js

## Challenges encountered and future enhancements
* The initial idea of the project was to have just the customer account. The chefs and dishes were hardcoded in app.js and comments were enabled via form.
* Since I felt that adding chef account would increase the usability of the application, I began working on it halfway into my project. Though it resulted in the scope creep of my project, it was definitely a good learning experience.
* Current version does not include image upload of in chef account (i.e., the ability for each chef to add his/her own image).
* I plan to add images per recipe too, as the customer can see the dish also while placing an order.
* I wish to refractor my code and make it more modular and adhere to best practices.
